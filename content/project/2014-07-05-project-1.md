Virgil Game is an educational game for museums, developed taking advantage of a telepresence robots, designed in a previous project. A treasure hunt concept was used to structure  of the service's design concept developed for the Royal Castle of Racconigi.

Through Virgil Game, visitors have the chance to visit fragile areas of the museum driving it by themselves in a semi-autonomous way, and finding some treasure (artifacts). Answering to some questions regarding these treasures allows to unlock a series of videos that deepen the visit experience.  The GUI, developed for the game, is connected to a  360-degree camera settled on the robot, giving a more immersive perspective of the area. The live streaming of the game is also duplicated on a big screen so everyone next to the player can get involved, by giving him suggestions or interacting with the game. The scope of the game is complete the treasure hunt in the faster way possible, and to make the experience more social by collecting the player's final score and comparing it to other players' score in a ranking.

The project is supported by MIUR and developed in collaboration with Castello di Racconigi (IT), Terre dei Savoia, and TIM.
