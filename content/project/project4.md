SHYBO is a small sound-reactive robot for children. This was developed within the framework of a research aimed at understanding how technology is affecting the role of play in childrenâ€™s everyday life and to define new meaningful scenarios of play.

In particular, SHYBO is designed to let children play with the physical environment and promote children's reasoning and let them play with sound-color combinations.

The project is supported by TIM and was developed in collaboration with [X-Studio](http://www.x-studio.org.cn), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.
