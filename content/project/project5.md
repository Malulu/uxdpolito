Phygital Play is a project focused on the screen time issue, a growing phenomenon, which may cause an increase of health issues.

A new gaming framework is proposed as a step forward in the virtual-physical contamination already largely addressed in research. The system consists of a projected playground, on which people and robot(s) can physically interact. The role of the robot is enhanced entrusting it different roles, from a companion, to an adversary, to the avatar of a remote player.

This project is supported by TIM and developed in collaboration with DAUIN, Department of Automation and Computer Science, Politecnico di Torino (IT).
