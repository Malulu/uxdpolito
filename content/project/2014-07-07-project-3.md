This project investigates the theme of visitor’s fatigue and hyper-congestion in museums. This consists of an interdisciplinary activity developed at a large scale museum, the Egyptian Museum of Turin, Italy.

The project explores the possibility of implementing a non-invasive sensor system that aims to track visitor’s behaviour, and suggests new and custom museum pathways. 

The project is supported by TIM and developed in collaboration with [Museo Egizio](http://www.museoegizio.it), Turin, Italy.
