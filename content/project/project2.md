Virgil is a telepresence robot that allows visitors to explore inaccessible areas of Cultural Heritage contexts, such as castles and historical residences.

The robot was designed as part of a project focused on the issue of inaccessibility in Cultural Heritage, due to lack of restoration and safety. The project was carried out at the Royal Residence of Racconigi Castle, in Italy, where many areas are excluded from the tour route. The proposed service allows visitors to explore remotely the inaccessible areas through Virgil, the robot teleoperated by a Museum Guide, who is entrusted of the cultural storytelling activity.

The project was developed in collaboration with Castello di Racconigi (IT), TIM and [Terre dei Savoia](http://www.visitterredeisavoia.it/Default.aspx) association.

Virgil was awarded in 2015 as one of the most innovative digital projects for Cultural Heritage, [Digital Think-In](http://www.maxxi.art/events/digital-think-in-call/), Rome (IT).
